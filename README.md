# University Email Deleter
The goal of this project is to create a webapp that categorizes emails into filters.

These filters will filter emails into a label.

Then the webapp will prompt the user, showing various colleges that have sent you emails, to delete and unsubscribe from certain universities that you would not like to attend.

Build using the Gmail API and HTML, JavaScript, CSS.
